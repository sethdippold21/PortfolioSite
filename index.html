							<p>I am a fourth year student at the University of Cincinnati studying Computer Science.  This past co-op term, I worked at Siemens PLM Software in their research and development group.  I worked with new technologies and languages that I had never had any experience with such as: Node.js, Semantic Databases, Microsoft's AR technology, HoloLens, and more.  I aim to graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science focusing on software development. </p>

						    	<p>My first three co-op terms were at Siemens PLM Software.  For my first two terms at Siemens, I worked on a 3D modeling and design software called NX doing a variety of different tasks.  During my first co-op term, most of my tasks were focused on testing. I started with manual testing. This helped me get a feel for the software and understand what I would be coding on for the rest of the term. Later, I moved on to writing autotests.  These tests were primarily written in C++ and were meant for regression testing. I wrote around 20 tests that I maintained and modified over the semester.  These tests were all integrated into the nightly testing runs ensuring that NX was working correctly. In addition to testing, I also fixed bugs and implemented new features throughout the semester.  
							    <br>My second term at Siemens was very similar to the first, however, I had a greater variety of projects. One of the main jobs that I had was to come up with around 90 manual tests for a change that was getting pushed through. I had to think of edge cases and document every result that I found.  This forced me to think outside the box with many scenarios and, ultimately, found many bugs that were present in the code.  I also worked on problem reports over the semester. Problem reports are issues found from end users or developers within the company. I was assigned them to take a look at and find the core issue. These were tougher than my usual jobs because they required me to step into code that I was not familiar with. 
							    <br> For my third term at Siemens PLM, I worked in the CTO group. This was essentially the research and development for the company.  I worked on a huge variety of new technologies and languages which I had no experience in.

							<p>
								I worked as an IT Support Intern at Crown Equipment Corporation the summers after senior year of high school and Freshman year of college. As an intern, I was given a diversity of tasks to do.  One of my main projects was to upgrade our existing monitoring software on the office televisions to a simpler layout.  Originally, the layout was crowded and very hard to read. I used a dashboard framework called Dashing to display server information from the databases such as bandwidth and temperature.  This was one of my very first coding experiences and taught me a lot about programming.  I also worked a lot with both physical and virtual servers. On many occasions, I helped upgrade and install new servers into the datacenter as well as generate layouts of the datacenters in Microsoft Visio.

								<p> 
									During my third year, I took a Web Design elective that I really enjoyed. It was a new experience for me, and I learned a lot about responsive web design, HTML, and CSS. The Wakeboarding Club Homepage was my final project for that class. I decided to create a website for the Wakeboarding Club because it was a new club that my friends and I started up.

                            <p>
								CEAS Ambassadors is a student group that I have recently joined. We give tours to prospective engineering students and organize other engineering recruitment events on campus.  My tour with an engineering ambassador at UC had a huge impact on why I decided to go to school here, so I really wanted to do the same for new students.  I enjoy meeting and getting to know these potential students and their families while guiding them on my tours.

                                Serve Beyond Cincinnati is another student group at the University of Cincinnati that organizes service trips over Winter, Fall, Spring, and Summer breaks. Groups are sent to areas in the U.S. and also internationally.  I have been a part of two SBC trips so far.  The first trip I took was to Give Kids The World Village in Orlando, Florida.  Give Kids The World Village is a nonprofit resort that provides cost-free vacations to children with life-threatening illnesses and their families.  Our group volunteered at the village for a week in August of 2015. We did everything from serving food to families to operating amusement rides for the children.  It was a great experience that I will never forget.
								<br><br>
                                I took another trip during spring break of 2017.  We travelled to Guatemala to work on construction projects that would increase the quality of life for families.  Most of what we worked on was construction. We mixed and poured the concrete foundation for a house, dug trenches for the foundation of another building, and built brick stoves for families living in very poor conditions.  This was all extremely tough work, but knowing that we making a difference in these families lives made it much easier.  I learned a lot about Guatemalan culture and also what to do in an airport when you are stuck for twelve hours.
